# 0x06 Python Classes

This repository contains Python scripts and exercises related to object-oriented programming using classes in Python.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find Python scripts and exercises focusing on the concept of classes in Python. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that allows you to structure your code in a way that models real-world entities as objects with attributes and behaviors. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating data and functionality into a single unit.

## Content

- `0-square.py`: Introduction to classes and objects with a simple `Square` class.
- `1-square.py`: Adding functionality to the `Square` class with methods to set and retrieve the size of the square.
- `2-square.py`: Adding error handling to the `Square` class to validate the size input.
- `3-square.py`: Enhancing the `Square` class with methods to calculate the area of the square.
- `4-square.py`: Expanding the `Square` class with methods to print the square using `print()` function.
- `5-square.py`: Introducing a method to print the square using `__str__` magic method.
- `6-square.py`: Implementing getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute of the `Square` class.

## Usage

To run the scripts in this repository, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Execute the scripts using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```
