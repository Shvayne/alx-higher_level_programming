# 0x08 Python More Classes

This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the concept of classes in Python and explores more advanced features.

## Files

1. **0-rectangle.py**: Defines a Rectangle class with width and height attributes.
2. **1-rectangle.py**: Builds on the previous script by adding methods to compute the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
3. **2-rectangle.py**: Adds validation checks to ensure that width and height are positive integers.
4. **3-rectangle.py**: Implements special methods to allow for string representation and usage of the `print()` function.
5. **4-rectangle.py**: Enhances the class by adding methods to compare rectangles based on their areas.
6. **5-rectangle.py**: Extends the class with a method to print a message when a rectangle is deleted.
7. **6-rectangle.py**: Adds a class attribute to keep track of the number of instances created.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. For example:

```bash
$ python3 0-main.py
```
